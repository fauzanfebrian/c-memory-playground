# C Advanced Programming Practice

Personal repo for learning and practicing advanced C programming topics.

All code and notes here are based on the Udemy course: **"C Programming Advanced Topics: Pointers, Memory, Low-Level C
Language and Embedded C Preparation"** by **Vlad Budnitski**
[Course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-pointers-from-zero-to-hero/)

## 🧠 Focus Areas

-   Deep dive into pointers (incl. pointer arithmetic, multi-level indirection, function pointers)
-   Manual memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
-   Debugging tools & techniques (Valgrind, GDB)
-   Structs, arrays, strings & how they interact with pointers
-   Low-level C concepts and Embedded C preparation
-   Bitwise operations, memory alignment, and more

## 🛠️ Why this Repo Exists

This is my scratchpad. Mostly used for:

-   Code experiments from the course
-   Concept breakdowns and mental models
-   Practice with edge cases and C memory behavior
-   Random notes or tests as I go through the material

No structure. No documentation. No support. Just raw learning.
