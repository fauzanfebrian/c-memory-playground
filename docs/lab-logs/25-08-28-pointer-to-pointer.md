### Pointer to Pointer

In this section, Vlad gave the simple exercise to deep understanding into pointer. The Pointer that point into a
Pointer, sound confusing? yes it is. But in my understanding this Pointer to Pointer thing is really usefull to us, the
programmer, to manage memory in a better way.

#### Advantage

1. Simplified memory management, with this approach we can initialize the place of the first pointer.
2. We can create a dynamic array of strings, or array of arrays with this approach.
