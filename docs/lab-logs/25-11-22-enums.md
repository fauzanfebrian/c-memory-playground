# Enum Usage

Enum usage and declaration in C is just the same like in Typescript, but with a difference that in C you cannot insert a string value into the enum, the value is only limited for the integer.

Example In Typescript:
```ts
enum Months {
    JAN = "January",
    FEB = "February",
    MAR = "March"
}

enum Months2 {
    JAN,
    FEB,
    MAR
}
```

Look at that, in typescript you can specify string for the enum value, in the other hand, in C you cannot do that, instead you do manual translation:

```c
enum months {
    JAN,
    FEB,
    MAR
};

char* monthsStr[] = {"January", "February", "March"};
```

See that, you should create difference variable for translating it, or you can just use IF statement, whatever.
